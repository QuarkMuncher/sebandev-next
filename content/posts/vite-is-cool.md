## Getting Started
### Soo getting started
To get started we need to initialize a project with Vite

> Requires at least node@v12.0.0

```shell
npm init vite@latest
--OR--
yarn create vite
--OR--
pnpm create vite
```

starts the vite init wizard, go like this:
- Project name: whatever you wanna call it.
- Select a framework: vanilla
- Select a variant: vanilla(vanilla-ts, _if you're feeling adventurous_)
