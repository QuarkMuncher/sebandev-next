description: 'I am passionate about back- & front-end development; understanding is the fuel that fires my engines & constructing satisfying user experiences is the river that waters my mind forest. I write small programs in my free time, utilizing: rust, php, html, css, js and sql to better understand concepts I have trouble wrapping my head around.'
